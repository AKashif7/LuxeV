    <p><strong>These are the sections I worked on:</strong></p>
    <p><a href = "#userProfile">- User profile</a></p>
    <p><a href = "#teamPage">- Team page</a></p>

    <div id = "userProfile">
        <div><h3>User profile</h3></div>
        <p>The user profile takes in multiple user inputs, for multiple questions asked via prompts, in an attempt to build a user profile for the user.</p>
        <p>The questions are presented in html to the user, and user inputs are taken from promts.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is used to take in user inputs for multiple questions by presenting corresponding prompts, and it is used to check for validation. If the user input is valid, the answer to a question on the page is updated to reflect their input. Otherwise questions are marked as unanswered.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is also used to load a section of questions at a time, and to allow for question answers to be edited.</p>

    <div id = "teamPage">
        <div><h3>Team page</h3></div>
        <p>When a user hovers their mouse over one of the four pictures of the team members, a 'dropdown' apears showing the team members student number for the project, as well as the web pages they have created.</p>
        <p>CSS is used here to add functionality such as changing styles when a users mouse is hovering over a part of the webpage.</p>
